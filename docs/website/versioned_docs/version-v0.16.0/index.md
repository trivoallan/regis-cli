```

  - **Skopeo**: Essential for multi-architecture registry inspection and metadata extraction.
- **Optional Analyzers**:
  - **Trivy**: Required for vulnerability scanning and SBOM generation.
  - **Hadolint**: Required for Dockerfile linting.
  - **Dockle**: Required for container image security linting.

```bash
pip install regis-cli
```

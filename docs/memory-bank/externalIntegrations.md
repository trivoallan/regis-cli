## Service Contracts

- Registry and CI integrations rely on external tool behavior and API compatibility
- Some analyzers require binaries such as `trivy`, `skopeo`, `hadolint`, and `dockle`

## Integration Patterns

- Mostly synchronous CLI and workflow integrations
- Tool availability is validated at runtime for some analyzers
- CI artifacts are emitted for consumption by users and downstream automation

## Environment-Specific Config

- GitHub App authentication is used in workflows
- CI secrets referenced in workflows should remain outside the Memory Bank

# Business Logic

## Domain Rules
- Container analysis results must be evaluated consistently across analyzers and playbooks.
- Policy decisions should be reproducible from the stored analyzer outputs and rule definitions.

## Business Workflows
- Analyze an image or registry artifact.
- Run multiple analyzers concurrently.
- Evaluate playbook rules against the collected evidence.
- Produce human-readable and machine-readable outputs.

## Validation Rules
- Analyzer outputs should conform to their schemas.
- Playbook results should remain valid JSON structures.
- Security-related checks should fail clearly when severity thresholds are exceeded.

## Edge Cases & Exceptions
- Some analyzers depend on external tools being available in `PATH`.
- Registry access may require authentication.
- Release workflows may behave differently for Dependabot or protected branches.

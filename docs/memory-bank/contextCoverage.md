## Gaps Identified

- Import alias configuration was not found in the inspected files.
- No explicit environment variable inventory was found in the inspected files.
- Database, events, and health-check details are not documented in the inspected files.

## Staleness Risk

- `activeContext.md` and `progress.md` will go stale quickly without session updates.

## Improvement Actions

- Add more precise dependency and architecture notes as the codebase changes.
- Update coverage entries whenever significant features, workflows, or integrations change.

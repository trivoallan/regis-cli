= Quickstart with Cookiecutter

You can quickly bootstrap a new repository dedicated to image analysis and security scoring using our official Cookiecutter template.

== Prerequisites

- `cookiecutter` installed in your environment.
- `regis-cli` installed or accessible via Docker.

== Usage

To create a new project, run the following command from the root of the `regis-cli` repository:

[source,bash]
----
pipenv run cookiecutter cookiecutter/
----

You will be prompted for several variables:

* `project_name`: The human-readable name of your analysis project.
* `project_slug`: The directory name for your project (defaults to a slugified version of the name).
* `registry_domain`: The domain of the registry you'll be analyzing (e.g., `ghcr.io`).
* `repository_owner`: The owner or organization of the repositories.

== What's Included

The template generates a fully functional repository with:

- **GitHub Actions**: A starter workflow in `.github/workflows/analyze.yml` that runs `regis-cli` weekly.
- **Scorecards**: A default security scorecard in `scorecards/default.yaml`.
- **Memory Bank**: A structured `docs/memory-bank/` directory to document project context and progress.
- **README**: Clear instructions for running analysis locally and in CI.

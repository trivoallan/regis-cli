:description: Guide to using regis-cli in GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

This guide explains how to integrate `regis-cli` into your GitLab CI/CD pipelines to automate container image analysis and security scoring.

== Prerequisites

* A GitLab project.
* GitLab Runner with Docker executor.
* (Optional) `glab` CLI installed locally.

== Bootstrapping a New Project

You can use `cookiecutter` to quickly create a new GitLab repository pre-configured for `regis-cli`.

[source,bash]
----
# Generate the project from the unified template (choose 'gitlab')
pipenv run cookiecutter cookiecutter/

# Create the repository on GitLab and push
cd <your-project-slug>
glab repo create --public
----

== GitLab CI Configuration

The generated `.gitlab-ci.yml` uses GitLab CI `spec: inputs` to parameterize the image analysis.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$gitlab-ci-fragment.yml[]
----

[NOTE]
====
In GitLab CI, the workspace is automatically available. The template uses a `before_script` to symlink workspace directories to the `/app/playbooks` and `/app/reports` paths expected by the `regis-cli` container.
====

== Running Analysis

Once pushed, you can trigger an analysis manually from the GitLab UI:

1. Go to **Build > Pipelines**.
2. Click **Run pipeline**.
3. Enter the `image_url` input.
4. Click **Run pipeline**.

== Publishing to GitLab Pages

`regis-cli` reports are perfectly suited for GitLab Pages. In GitLab CI, any files placed in a directory named `public` at the end of a job named `pages` will be automatically published.

=== Deployment Job

Add the following job to your `.gitlab-ci.yml`:

[source,yaml]
----
pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - mkdir -p public
    - cp -r reports/* public/
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  only:
    - main
----

The analysis results will be accessible at `https://<your-namespace>.gitlab.io/<your-project-slug>/`.

== Report Versioning

To keep a history of your analysis reports directly in the Git repository, you need to configure a **Project Access Token**:

1. Go to **Settings > Access Tokens**.
2. Create a new token with:
   * **Name**: `GITLAB_TOKEN`
   * **Scopes**: `write_repository`
3. Copy the token.
4. Go to **Settings > CI/CD > Variables**.
5. Add a variable named `GITLAB_TOKEN`, paste the token value, and ensure it is **masked**.

When this variable is present, the CI pipeline will automatically commit and push new reports to your branch.

== Adding CI Metadata

You can enrich your reports with GitLab CI metadata using the `--meta` flag. The default playbook uses the following well-known keys:

* `trigger.user`: The user who initiated the analysis (e.g., `$GITLAB_USER_LOGIN`).
* `trigger.url`: A link to the CI job (e.g., `$CI_JOB_URL`).

[source,bash]
----
regis-cli analyze <image-url> \
  --meta "trigger.user=$GITLAB_USER_LOGIN" \
  --meta "trigger.url=$CI_JOB_URL"
----

== Self-Service Analysis (Request-to-MR)

The unified GitLab template supports a full "Self-Service" workflow where any user can request an image analysis via a pipeline input. This creates a focused Merge Request with a dedicated report deployed to a Review App.

    actor User as User/Developer
    participant GL as GitLab UI
    participant CI as CI Runner
    participant Reg as Registry

    User->>GL: Run Pipeline with image_url
    GL->>CI: Job: request_analysis
    Note over CI: Create branch & commit image_url
    CI->>GL: Push with MR options
    GL->>User: Merge Request opened
    GL->>CI: Job: analyze_image (MR context)
    CI->>Reg: Analyze image
    CI->>GL: Commit Report (optional)
    CI->>GL: Expose "Analysis Report" Artifact
....

=== 1. Trigger the Request
Go to **Build > Pipelines > Run pipeline**, enter the `image_url`, and run.

=== 2. Merge Request Creation
The pipeline automatically creates a new branch and a Merge Request.
The MR description contains instructions to find the **Analysis Report** within the Merge Request artifacts.

=== 3. Report Inspection
Once the analysis job completes, the report is:
*   **Committed** back to the branch (if `GITLAB_TOKEN` is configured).
*   **Exposed** directly in the Merge Request UI under the "Analysis Report" artifact link.

=== 4. Governance
Security teams can review the MR, check the compliance score via the exposed HTML report, and decide whether to merge the analysis request into the main registry branch.

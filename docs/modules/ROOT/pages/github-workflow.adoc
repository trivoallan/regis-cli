= regis-cli in GitHub Actions

You can use `regis-cli` in your GitHub workflows to analyze your container images and generate security scorecards.

== Example Usage

Below is a basic example of how to use `regis-cli` to analyze a Docker image and upload the report as an artifact.

[source,yaml]
----
name: Image Analysis

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  analyze:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python_version: '3.10'

      - name: Install Pipenv and dependencies
        run: |
          pip install pipenv
          pipenv install --deploy

      - name: Run regis-cli
        run: |
          pipenv run regis-cli analyze my-image:latest -f html -f json

      - name: Upload Report
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: regis-report
          path: reports/
----

== Analysis with Scorecards

To evaluate your image against a specific scorecard:

[source,yaml]
----
      - name: Run regis-cli with Scorecard
        run: |
          pipenv run regis-cli analyze my-image:latest -s examples/all-reports.yaml
----

== Using the Docker Image

You can also run `regis-cli` directly via Docker if the project provides a containerized version (see the `Dockerfile` in the root).

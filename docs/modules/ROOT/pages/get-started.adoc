= Get Started

This guide helps you install `regis-cli` and run your first container image analysis.

== Prerequisites

Before you install `regis-cli`, ensure that your environment meets the following requirements:

* **Python**: Version 3.10 or later.
* **Pipenv**: For managing dependencies and virtual environments.
* **External Tools**:
** **Skopeo**: Used for multi-architecture registry inspection.
** **Trivy**: Required for vulnerability scanning and SBOM generation.
** **Hadolint** (Optional): Required for Dockerfile linting.

== Installation

To install `regis-cli` in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or navigate to your project directory.
2. Install the dependencies using Pipenv:

[source,bash]
----
pipenv install
----

This command creates a virtual environment and installs all required packages as defined in the `Pipfile`.

== Run your first analysis

You can analyze any public container image without additional configuration. To analyze the latest `nginx` image and view the results in your terminal as JSON, run the following command:

[source,bash]
----
pipenv run regis-cli analyze nginx:latest
----

== Generate a report site

To generate a rich HTML report instead of JSON output, use the `--site` (or `-s`) flag:

[source,bash]
----
pipenv run regis-cli analyze nginx:latest --site
----

By default, the tool writes reports to the `reports/` directory. You can find the HTML report at `reports/docker.io/library/nginx/latest/index.html`.

== Use the security playbook

To get the most out of `regis-cli`, you should evaluate your images against a security playbook. We recommend starting with our default playbook, which includes rules for vulnerability counts and image freshness:

[source,bash]
----
pipenv run regis-cli analyze nginx:latest --site \
  -p https://raw.githubusercontent.com/trivoallan/regis-cli/refs/heads/main/regis_cli/playbooks/default.yaml
----

== Next steps

* **Registry Authentication**: Learn how to analyze private images by providing credentials.
* **Custom Playbooks**: Define your own security and compliance rules in the xref:playbooks.adoc[Understand Playbooks] guide.
* **CI/CD Integration**: See our guides for xref:github-workflow.adoc[GitHub Workflows] and xref:gitlab-workflow.adoc[GitLab CI].
